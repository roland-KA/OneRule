# OneRule.jl

Implementation of the *1-Rule* data mining algorithm using the Julia programming language.

The implementation of this algorithm is intended for teaching purposes; it's not for production use. 
It has been created for a university course in data science at [Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg Cooperative State University  Karlsruhe](https://www.karlsruhe.dhbw.de/en/general/about-us.html)

For more information about the algorithm see e.g.: https://datacadamia.com/data_mining/one_rule or have look
